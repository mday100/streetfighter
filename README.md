## Summary

Street Fighter is a series of fighting games by Capcom. The game's playable characters originate from around the world, each with his or her own unique fighting style. It is Capcom's second best-selling franchise, enjoying significant success all around the world. This was one of the first static HTML pages I made utilizing jQuery with the help of [Thinkful] (http://www.thinkful.com).

Built with straight up HTML / CSS / and jQuery on the frontend.

Hosted on GitHub Pages.
